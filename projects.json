    "synopsis": "In this report we analyze the difference in particulate matter, PM2.5, in the United States between years 2012 and 2016. PM2.5 are produced from all types of combustion, including motor vehicles, power plants, residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning and some indusrial processes. We obtained PM2.5 FRM/FEM Mass (88101) data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. http://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html#Daily We downloaded data for the years 2012 and 2016 from the Particulates table to the same local folder which this Markdown file resides. From these data, we found that, on average across the U.S., levels of PM2.5 have decreased between 2012 and 2016."

    "synopsis": "Traditional belief has stated that cars with manual transmissions would be more fuel-efficient than cars with automatic transmissions. But as technology becomes more advanced, is manual transmission still better in fuel economy than automatic transmission in terms of mpg? In this report we will explore the 2012 fuel economy guide produced by the US Environmental Protection Agency and US Department of Energy to answer this question. The dataset is downloaded via URL “http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml” and saved as csv format. The transmission column specifies different types of motor vehicle transmission and gears, for clarification I add a column that categorized them into either automatic and manual transmission. Likewise, I catagorize the displacement into families of 1,2,3-liter and revmove electric cars to clarify comparison."
