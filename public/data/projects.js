    synopsis: 'This is a Coursera Machine Learning course project write-up to evaluate weight lifting exercise. The premise of the study and dataset can be found in Human Activity Recognition (HAR), http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. The data being studied here is a subset from HAR and are downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv. I’ll combine predictions from three models: Random Forest, generalized Boosted Regression and Support Vector Machine using Random Forest to predict the 20 test cases from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv',

    synopsis: 'Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that nonmetropolitan areas have significant numbers of Potentially Excess Deaths from the five leading causes of death (heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke). This storyboard leverage data from that report by presenting  information on Deaths from the five leading causes of death at the state level (combining deaths from nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas) in an interactive map chart. Upon clicking a state, the statistics is displayed in a line chart in the upper right corner. We downloaded data from following URL:                          https://blogs.cdc.gov/nchs-data-visualization/state-data-accompanying-mmwr-surveillance-summary-66no-ss-11-8-potentially-excess-deaths-from-the-five-leading-causes-of-death-in-nonmetropolitan-and-metropolitan-areas-united-states-2005-2015/',

    synopsis: 'In this report we analyze the difference in particulate matter, PM2.5, in the United States between years 2012 and 2016. PM2.5 are produced from all types of combustion, including motor vehicles, power plants, residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning and some indusrial processes. We obtained PM2.5 FRM/FEM Mass (88101) data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "http://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html#Daily" We downloaded data for the years 2012 and 2016 from the Particulates table to the same local folder which this Markdown file resides. From these data, we found that, on average across the U.S., levels of PM2.5 have decreased between 2012 and 2016.',

    synopsis: 'Traditional belief has stated that cars with manual transmissions would be more fuel-efficient than cars with automatic transmissions. But as technology becomes more advanced, is manual transmission still better in fuel economy than automatic transmission in terms of mpg? In this report we will explore the 2012 fuel economy guide produced by the US Environmental Protection Agency and US Department of Energy to answer this question. The dataset is downloaded via URL “http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml” and saved as csv format. The transmission column specifies different types of motor vehicle transmission and gears, for clarification I add a column that categorized them into either automatic and manual transmission. Likewise, I catagorize the displacement into families of 1,2,3-liter and revmove electric cars to clarify comparison.',
