    synopsis: 'In this report we explore the NOAA Storm Database to consider which natural events (ex. tornado, hail, snow, flood, etc.) are most harmful with respect to population health and / or have the greatest economic consequences across the United States from 1950 to 2011.',

    synopsis: 'In this report we aggregate and plot data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.',

    synopsis: 'Traditional belief has stated that cars with manual transmissions would be more fuel-efficient than cars with automatic transmissions. But as technology becomes more advanced, is manual transmission still better in fuel economy than automatic transmission in terms of mpg? In this report we will explore the 2012 fuel economy guide produced by the US Environmental Protection Agency and US Department of Energy to answer this question. The dataset is downloaded via URL “http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml” and saved as csv format. The transmission column specifies different types of motor vehicle transmission and gears, for clarification I add a column that categorized them into either automatic and manual transmission. Likewise, I catagorize the displacement into families of 1,2,3-liter and revmove electric cars to clarify comparison.',
