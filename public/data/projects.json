    "synopsis": "This is a Coursera Machine Learning course project write-up to evaluate weight lifting exercise. The premise of the study and dataset can be found in Human Activity Recognition (HAR), http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. The data being studied here is a subset from HAR and are downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv The training data are compiled from sensors set up in belt, glove, arm-band and dumbbell worn by research subjects. Responses were recorded during ten repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Bisceps Curl with a barbell in five different classifications: Classes A, B, C, D and E. Class A being the correct execution and the other classes simulate common mistakes by novices. The course instruction is to use readings from the accelerometers only for prediction model, which reduces the parameters from 160 to 20 plus “classe” as output. In this report I’ll describe how I build my model with a training set with cross-validation, perfrom prediction on a testing set (both sets are split from pml-training.csv), and show overall prediction accuracy. I’ll combine predictions from three models: Random Forest, generalized Boosted Regression and Support Vector Machine using Random Forest to predict the 20 test cases from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

PM2.5 are produced from all types of combustion, including motor vehicles, power plants, residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning and some indusrial processes. We obtained PM2.5 FRM/FEM Mass (88101) data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. http://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html#Daily We downloaded data for the years 2012 and 2016 from the Particulates table to the same local folder which this Markdown file resides. From these data, we found that, on average across the U.S., levels of PM2.5 have decreased between 2012 and 2016."

    "synopsis": "Traditional belief has stated that cars with manual transmissions would be more fuel-efficient than cars with automatic transmissions. But as technology becomes more advanced, is manual transmission still better in fuel economy than automatic transmission in terms of mpg? In this report we will explore the 2012 fuel economy guide produced by the US Environmental Protection Agency and US Department of Energy to answer this question. The dataset is downloaded via URL “http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml” and saved as csv format. The transmission column specifies different types of motor vehicle transmission and gears, for clarification I add a column that categorized them into either automatic and manual transmission. Likewise, I catagorize the displacement into families of 1,2,3-liter and revmove electric cars to clarify comparison."
